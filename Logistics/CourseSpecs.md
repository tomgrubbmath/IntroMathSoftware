Math 157 was taught online (as Winter 2021 fell under the COVID pandemic). Lectures were held on Zoom and recorded to allow for asynchronous viewing. 

The course was run on CoCalc, using upgraded accounts for each student. Lectures were written on Jupyter Notebooks which were then distributed to each student. Homeworks and Quizzes were also on Jupyter Notebooks. The Final Project was an open ended assignment in which students wrote a lecture and presented to small groups. 

The course chat ran on Zulip: https://zulip.com/ ; we had individual streams for each lecture and for each homework question.
