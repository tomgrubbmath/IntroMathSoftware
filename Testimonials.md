## Overview
I am making this course material available in part so that I have something to add to my teaching portfolio. Accordingly, I have decided to add a few pieces of student feedback below. This feedback was collected as part of UC San Diego's CAPES; this is the university's way of collecting student feedback on courses and instructors at the end of the term. 

## Notes:
Any remarks on student feedback would not be complete without the following information: 
- I am a white male. Studies have shown that this will *positively bias* my evaluations, for no good reason. See, for instance, [Exploring Bias in Student Evaluations: Gender, Race, and Ethnicity] (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/exploring-bias-in-student-evaluations-gender-race-and-ethnicity/91670F6003965C5646680D314CF02FA4). 
-  The class was taught in my native tongue (English). This also *positively biases* my evaluations. See, for instance, [The Influence of Instructor Native Language on Student Learning and Instructor Ratings] (https://www.jstor.org/stable/40326049?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
-  The class grades were *quite high* (88% of a student's grade in this class was based on homework, participation, and the final project; most students did the work, and their grades reflected that). The relationships of this with student evaluations is discussed here: [Do Higher Grades Lead to Favorable Student Evaluations?] (https://www.jstor.org/stable/30042630?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
