- Lecture 11: Graph Theory Pt 1: Constructors, Random Graphs, Colorings, Planarity, Cycles/Circuits
- Lecture 12: Graph Theory Pt 2: Weighted Graphs, Directed Graphs, Reading Files in Python

#### Lectures 13 - 16: Number Theory/Cryptography
- Lecture 13: Basic Number Theory (GCDs, CRT, Primality, Factorization, Fermat's Little Theorem, Euler Totient, Multiplicative Order/Inverses mod N)
- Lecture 14: One Time Pads, Discrete Logarithms, "Polynomial/Exponential Runtime", Diffie-Hellman-Merkle, Weak Primes
- Lecture 15: Final Project Overview, CRT Attack on DHM, Baby Steps Giant Steps, RSA
- Lecture 16: RSA Review, RSA Keygen in a Terminal (and then decoding all the output in Sage), Pseudorandomness, Elliptic Curves

#### Lectures 17 - 19: Statistics and Data Wrangling:
- *Homebrew* Data Wrangling (no Pandas; Python builtins like read, strip, split, etc), Summary Statistics, Linear Regression via OLS
- Pandas (Sorting, Aggregating, Loc/Iloc, ...) (did not have time to do second half in the lecture file; pushed that to next lecture)
- "Real Life" Data Analysis (Train/Test Split, Categorical Variables, Preliminary Visualization, Imputing, Feature Engineering, Model Creation, Model Evaluation), Hypothesis Testing

#### Lectures 20-22: Natural Language Processing
- Lecture 20: Stylometry (with a *very* quick introduction to classifiers)
- Lecture 21: Word Embeddings and the word2vec Algorithm
- Lecture 22: Information Retrieval/Query Expansion

#### Lectures 23 - 25: Miscellany
- Lecture 23: High Performance Computing (Cython), Code Profiling/Optimization
- Lecture 24: Decision Tree Classifiers, Classifier Evaluation Metrics, MNIST Digits, Random Forest Classifier
- Lecture 25: Course Wrap Up: What we did this quarter, Why and how to keep Math 157 in mind even if you do not end up in a "STEM" career, Python's OS module

#### "Missing" Lectures: 
- This quarter had 28 lectures of instruction scheduled (10 weeks M/W/F minus 2 holidays). There are 25 lecture files.
- One lecture was cancelled for Quiz 2 (I did not see how to usefully spend 20 minutes on ML/NLP)
- Two lectures were dedicated to final project work/presentations etc.
