    "What will you have to do for the final project? You will:\n",
    "- Write a 40-50 minute lecture on your chosen topic, consisting of\n",
    "    - An exposition of some of the mathematical *theory* surrounding your topic\n",
    "    - A discussion of how that topic can be studied *computationally*, using Sage or some other computing platform\n",
    "        - This discussion must include examples of code snippets that run and produce output\n",
    "        - These code snippets should highlight the theory\n",
    "    - An *application* of this mathematical topic to the real world\n",
    "    - At least one \"Participation Check\" (a short, interactive ~2 minute exercise)\n",
    "        - Note: You *do not* have to solve your groupmate's participation checks\n",
    "    - How you choose to split up your time between these three topics is up to you! You have to have *some* aspects of everything. \n",
    "- Write a \"mini-homework\" consisting of\n",
    "    - Two questions, roughly at the level of the questions you have been solving this quarter\n",
    "    - Solutions to those questions\n",
    "    - Note: you *do not* have to solve your groupmate's homework exercises\n",
    "- Present your lectures in groups of ~3\n",
    "    - You can set up this presentation at whatever time is convenient for your group\n",
    "    - The easiest way to do this is probably screensharing over Zoom\n",
    "    - This is meant to be a low pressure introduction to the art of mathematical presentation. As such, you will be expected to treat your groupmates with respect during their presentations\n",
    "- Write short feedback for each of your groupmate's presentations, consisting of\n",
    "    - A *short* summary of their topic (Which topic did they present on? What were the key ideas or applications?)\n",
    "    - One thing that *you liked* about their presentation\n",
    "    - One (respectfully worded) piece of constructive criticism/idea for what they could improve on for \"next time\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "How you choose to spend your time in your lecture is up to you! Some people will prefer to focus more on the theory, other people will want to rush through the theory and get to the applications. Both methods are ok, as long as you don't skip any of the three requirements entirely!\n",
    "\n",
    "Links will be provided to you as *places to start* learning about your topic. You are free to take it in whatever direction you want!\n",

The keys we were able to compromise were generated incorrectly–using predictable “random” numbers that were sometimes repeated. There were two kinds of problems: keys that were generated with predictable randomness, and a subset of these, where the lack of randomness allows a remote attacker to efficiently factor the public key and obtain the private key. With the private key, an attacker can impersonate a web site or possibly decrypt encrypted traffic to that web site. We’ve developed a tool that can factor these keys and give us the private keys to all the hosts vulnerable to this attack on the Internet in only a few hours.\n",
