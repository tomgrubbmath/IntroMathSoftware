# IntroMathSoftware
This is a collection of course material that I used to teach UCSD's Math 157: Introduction to Mathematical Software in Winter 2021.

### Acknowledgements
Math 157 is a course that has been taught at UCSD for the past 5 or so years. While I made personal decisions and variations regarding the course material, this course was highly influenced by previous versions of the course. These were run by Kiran Kedlaya and Peter Wear. I am additionally grateful to Kiran and Peter for many useful conversations regarding the class. Many useful edits to the course material were made by the course TAs, Patrick Girardet and JJ Garzella. 

### Repository Setup

This repository is organized as follows:
- Main directory: Contains README.md, licensing information, and pointers to subdirectories.
- Lectures directory: Contains 25 subdirectories, one for each lecture in the class. Each subdirectory contains a Jupyter Notebook as well as various ancillary files
- Assignments directory: Contains 8 subdirectories, one for each homework assignment in the class. Each subdirectory contains a Jupyter Notebook of the *blank* homework assignment and ancillary files (I have made a conscious decision to *not* upload solutions; these are accessible if you email me)
- Quizzes directory: Contains 4 subdirectories. Two subdirectories contain files for *practice quizzes* and two subdirectories contain files for *actual quizzes* which were held in the class
- Final Project directory: Contains details regarding the final project for the class

### Caveat Emptor

A running warning for this repository: you are welcome to reuse any material found here (subject to the appropriate LICENSE file), but I highly recommend double checking for errors if you do. While I made efforts to make the files within as error-free as possible, there are certainly typos and mistakes which remain (especially in light of a saving bug that existed in CoCalc which has thankfully been fixed). Additionally, not all exercises which I created for this class were created equally. Some were unfortunately rushed and ill-posed.

### Contact Information

Please email me at tgrubb@ucsd.edu with any questions regarding Math 157. I am highly interested in *both* mathematical computation *and* mathematics education, so discussions regarding these topics are welcome and enjoyed.
